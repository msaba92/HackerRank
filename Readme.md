#### A collection of my solutions for the programming challenges that [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) offers, in several different languages.

I usually try to solve a problem in all of the languages I know before I move on to the next one.

So far it contains solutions in six different languages: PHP, Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby and C++.

These solutions might seem bizarre sometimes if one is unfamiliar with HackerRank, with unused variables and needless inputs. Unfortunately they're there to accomodate the site's test cases, which would otherwise fail even though a solution is better than the standard one.
