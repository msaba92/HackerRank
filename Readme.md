#### A collection of my solutions for the programming challenges that [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) offers, in several different languages.

So far it contains solutions in six different languages: PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby and C++.
Of course, in cases where an exercise does not accept one of these languages, I've been forced to leave such implementation out (such as in the 30 days challenges, where some exercises didn't accept JavaScript solutions).

There's also a subfolder for the SQL exercises.

I usually try to solve a problem in all of the languages I know before I move on to the next one.

### Note:
These solutions might seem bizarre sometimes if one is unfamiliar with HackerRank, with unused variables and needless inputs. Unfortunately they're there to accomodate the site's test cases, which would otherwise fail even though a solution is better than the standard one.

I have decided to include the terribly linted and very questionable HackerRank code along with my solutions so that they can be launched independently from the site.
However it should be noted that the JavaScript solutions, at least in Unix environment, require their input to be passed via piping rather than through standard input.

Example:
```
echo "8\nHacker\nRank" | node 06.js
```
