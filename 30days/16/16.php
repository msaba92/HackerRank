// It seems HackerRank challenge writers are a bunch of ill-trained monkeys,
// since they didn't even realize several languages do NOT throw an exception
// when parsing strings to int. Unfortunately it's not immediate to solve this
// challenge in languages like PHP or javascript (see the solution in this
// folder), so I just left PHP out for this day.
// Even funnier is that ANYTHING in the code containing "if", including comments
// that have no actual code, will make this challenge fail, even if the output is
// correct. Way to go, HackerRank!
